            <h1>CADAA</h1>
            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">The CADAA (Computer Aided Detection Agonist Antagonist) is an R-Shiny application designed to find
       			an agonist / antagonist of an unknown substance relative to drugs affecting GPCR receptors using graph
				theory and similar networks by supervised machine learning algorithms. In this research, first the SDF file
				related to the unknown substance is taken from the input and compared with the data made from the database
				of 400 drugs affecting GPCR receptors, which were created using a random walk fingerprint, and then Finding
				the most similar drug to an unknown substance indicates that it has an agonistic or antagonistic role on
				GPCR receptors, as well as the receptors on which this unknown substance may act.<br>

                In other words, this web-based application, by presenting candidate drugs, determines what kind of action the
				unknown substance has on GPCR receptors.<br>
